# My Piggybank

## Overview

My Piggybank is an app geared towards preschoolers and grade school children to begin teaching them what spending and saving money means. It's a fun way for them to visualize how much money goes in/out of their own piggybank and always keep track of how much is in there.

### Problem

Kids who have a piggybank rarely know how much is in there unless they periodically take all the money out and count it, this app allows them to always know the contents of their piggybank by recording whenever they put in or take out money.
